## ASP.NET Core Role-based vs Claim-based Authorization – Practical Comparison

### My Scenario

I'm building an authorization system where:

- Users are assigned to **Roles**.
- Each Role has a set of **Permissions** (e.g., `dashboard.view`, `article.delete`, etc.).
- I want to **protect controllers/actions** using policies that depend on these permissions.
- Permissions are stored in the database.

---

## Two Code Approaches I Tried

### **Approach 1 – Role-based Policies**

In this approach, I group all permissions and assign them to the roles that have them. I generate policies for each permission slug and require the roles that are linked to that permission.

```csharp
var permissionsGrouped = db.Permissions
    .Include(p => p.Roles)
    .ToList()
    .GroupBy(p => p.Slug);

builder.Services.AddAuthorization(options =>
{
    foreach (var group in permissionsGrouped)
    {
        var permissionSlug = group.Key;
        var roles = group.SelectMany(p => p.Roles).Select(r => r.Slug).Distinct();

        options.AddPolicy(permissionSlug, policy =>
            policy.RequireRole(roles.ToArray())); // OR logic: any of these roles
    }
});
```

### **Approach 2 – Claim-based Policies**

In this one, I tell ASP.NET Core:\
"For each permission, create a policy that expects a **claim** with type = `Permission` and value = `slug`."

```csharp
var permissions = db.Permissions.ToList();

builder.Services.AddAuthorization(options =>
{
    foreach (var permission in permissions)
    {
        options.AddPolicy(permission.Slug, policy =>
            policy.RequireClaim("Permission", permission.Slug));
    }
});
```

In this case, I must ensure that I manually add all permission claims to the user at login time (based on their role).

---

##  Do Both Work the Same?

Yes, **currently**, both approaches work **exactly the same** in my app because:

- The user has a **role**.
- The role has related **permissions**.
- So whether I check permissions via claims or via the role → permission relation, the result is identical.

---

## Why I Chose Claim-Based Authorization (Approach 2)

Although both work now, I chose **Approach 2** for the following reasons:

### Scalability

If I ever want to assign **permissions per user directly** (not just via role), I can easily do that by just adding/removing claims for the user.

### More Granular Control

Sometimes I want to **disable a single permission** for a specific user, even if their role includes it — claim-based makes this very easy.

### Standard Practice

Claim-based authorization is considered a **best practice** in large or dynamic systems. It gives me future flexibility.

---

## Real-world Example

Let’s say I have a role `Editor` with a permission `Article.Delete`.\
Now I want to prevent **only one editor** from deleting articles.

If I use **claim-based**, I can just remove the `Permission: Article.Delete` claim from that user.

---

## Final Conclusion

- Both approaches give the same logic **right now**.
- But claim-based authorization is **more scalable and flexible**.
- I’m currently sticking to claim-based even though I’m assigning permissions via roles — this keeps my system ready for any future need to assign permissions per user.
